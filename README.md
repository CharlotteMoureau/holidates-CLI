This is a simple solo project carried out on the 20th of April 2021 as part of the BeCode Li√®ge's Junior Web Developer programm. We were tasked to create a npm package and publish it.

```npm i @charlotte.m/holidates```

### Then run:

```holidates [country of your choice]```

#### You can specify the year you want (default is the current year) like this:

```holidates [country of your choice] [year]```
